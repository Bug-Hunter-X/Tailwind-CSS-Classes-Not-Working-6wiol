# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply despite being correctly defined in the configuration.

## Bug

The issue is that some classes are not working despite being correctly defined in the Tailwind config. For example, the `mx-auto` class is not centering the div. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the Tailwind directives are correctly imported and the build process is configured to correctly process Tailwind directives.
